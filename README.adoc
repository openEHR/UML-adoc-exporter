= UML-adoc-exporter

UML AsciiDoctor `.adoc` format class and diagram exporter for MagicDraw UML tool, release 19.x.

For more recent versions of MagicDraw, see the master branch of this repository.

== Installation of the plugin

If you just want to install the plugin to MagicDraw, the two files `UmlAdocExporter.jar` and `plugin.xml` need to be copied from `/plugin` to the location `<MagicDraw-install>/plugins/org.openehr.adoc.magicdraw`.

== Running the plugin

The plugin is used by the openEHR publishing toolchain in batch mode. Specifically, https://github.com/openEHR/specifications-AA_GLOBAL/blob/master/bin/uml_generate.sh[the script uml_generate.sh] is invoked by the script https://github.com/openEHR/specifications-AA_GLOBAL/blob/master/bin/do_spec_publish.sh[do_spec_publish.sh], run from the top `openEHR-specifications` directory, as https://github.com/openEHR/specifications-AA_GLOBAL[described here].

== Building

The repo is currently set up as an IntelliJ project that builds a .jar that works as a plugin for Magicdraw, as https://docs.nomagic.com/display/MD190/Plugins[described here].

Steps to performing a build:

* Clone the repo, e.g. into `openEHR/UML-adoc-exporter`
* open `/UmlAdocExporter.ipr` in IntelliJ
* Ensure the following are configured in IntelliJ
  * Java SDK and language level 8
  * In settings / Appearance & behaviour / path variables, ensure `$MAGIC_DRAW_INSTALL_DIRECTORY` points to the MagicDraw install directory, e.g. something like `/usr/loca/MagicDraw19.x`
  * Create an artifact called UmlAdocExporter:jar of type OTHER
* Performing a build will generate the file `/out/artifacts/UmlAdocExporter_jar/UmlAdocExporter.jar`.

If you make changes, the latest build should be copied to `/plugin` in this repo, for easy access by users without doing a build. Additionally, if you make changes to the file `UmlAdocExporter/plugin.xml`, also copy this file to `/plugin`.
