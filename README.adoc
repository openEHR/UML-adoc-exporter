= UML-adoc-exporter

UML AsciiDoctor `.adoc` format class and diagram exporter for MagicDraw UML tool, release 2024x. Note that MagicDraw is now owned and distributed by Dassault Systems as part of the Catia product suite.
https://docs.nomagic.com/display/MD2024x/Developer+Guide[Developer documentation^].

== Previous version(s)

Previous versions of this plug-in are found on branches. The version for MagicDraw 19.4 is found https://github.com/openEHR/UML-adoc-exporter/tree/MagicDraw-19.4[here^]. **To build and use a previous version, clone this repo and check out the appropriate branch**. 

== Installation of the plugin

To install the plugin to MagicDraw, the two files `UmlAdocExporter.jar` and `plugin.xml` need to be copied from `/plugin` to the location `<MagicDraw-install>/plugins/org.openehr.adoc.magicdraw`.

== Running the plugin

The plugin is used via direct command line invocation, using a script like the one shown below, assumed to be named `uml_generate_msa.sh`:

[source, bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

#
# Script created according to MagicDraw documentation file Specifying_batch_mode_program_classpath_and_required_system_properties.html
# 
# This script will only work with MagicDraw 2024x or later.
#

if [ -z "$MAGICDRAW_HOME" ]; then
    echo "MAGICDRAW_HOME environment variable not set, please set it to the MagicDraw installation folder"
    exit 1
fi

# Reads CLASSPATH value from magicdraw.properties files (change to your properties file name)
MD_CLASSPATH=`grep "CLASSPATH" $MAGICDRAW_HOME/bin/msa.properties | cut -d'=' -f 2`

# prepend MAGICDRAW_HOME to classpath
MD_CLASSPATH="$MAGICDRAW_HOME/$MD_CLASSPATH"

# add path to plugin
MD_CLASSPATH="$MD_CLASSPATH:$MAGICDRAW_HOME/plugins/org.openehr.magicdraw.adocexporter/MsaAsciidocExporterPlugin.jar"

# Adjust CP for operating system
if [ "$OS" = Windows_NT ]; then
    MD_CLASSPATH=$(echo "$MD_CLASSPATH" | sed "s/\\\:/;/g")
else
    MD_CLASSPATH=$(echo "$MD_CLASSPATH" | sed "s/\\\:/:/g")
fi

echo " ************* CP = $MD_CLASSPATH"

# Note that the version of java needed in the final invocation of this script is Java17 or later
java -Xmx1200M -Xss1024K \
       -cp "$MD_CLASSPATH" \
       -Desi.system.config="$MAGICDRAW_HOME/data/application.conf" \
       -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 \
       @$MAGICDRAW_HOME/bin/vm.options \
       org.openehr.magicdraw.adocexporter.UmlAdocExporterCommandLine "$@"

== Plug-in Usage

The command line arguments passed to the script above are passed to the plugin (see final line of script). Usage is as follows:

----
-c: component package name(s) under root package to export (comma-separated)
-P: component name prefix to use in links
-d: image format: svg|png (default = all)
-k: spec URL template
-o: output folder (default = current folder)
-l: class headings level (default = 3)
-p: UML package depth for uniqueness (default = 4);
-q: if set, use package-qualified class-names in output files (default = set)
-r: root package name to export (default = openehr)
----

The command line for openEHR looks as follows:

[source,bash]
----
# create a command that will look like the following
# -d svg
# -k /releases/\${component_prefix}\${component}/{\${component_lower}_release}/docs/\${spec_name}.html
# -p 4
# -r openehr
# -q
# -c AM
# -o docs/UML
# computable/UML/openEHR_UML-AM.mdzip
uml_regen_cmd="$ref_dir/bin/uml_generate_msa.sh -d svg -k ${link_template} -p $pkg_depth -r $uml_root_package ${package_qualifiers:+-q} -c $component -o docs/UML $uml_file"
----

== Plug-in Source Code

The plug-in relies on the UML 2.x OpenAPI from Catia. This is (as far as we can tell) a faithful implementation of the UML 2.5.1 meta-model. Note that breaking changes occurred between UML 2.5 and UML 2.5.1, to do with how stereotypes are represented (https://docs.nomagic.com/display/MD2021x/2021x+Version+News#id-2021xVersionNews-ProfilingChangesintheUML2.5.1Metamodel[described here^]), which meant that code changes were required between the MD 19.4 version of the extractor and the current one.

== Building

The repo is currently set up as an IntelliJ project that builds a .jar that works as a plugin for Magicdraw, as described in the MagicDraw 2024x documentation, found in $MAGICDRAW_HOME/openapi/guide.zip.

Steps to performing a build:

* Clone the repo, e.g. into `openEHR/UML-adoc-exporter`
* open `/UmlAdocExporter.ipr` in IntelliJ
* Performing a build will generate the file `/out/artifacts/UmlAdocExporter_jar/UmlAdocExporter.jar`.

If you make changes, the latest build should be copied to `/plugin` in this repo, for easy access by users without doing a build. Additionally, if you make changes to the file `UmlAdocExporter/plugin.xml`, also copy this file to `/plugin`.

== Acknowledgements

The original version of the extractor was created by Bo≈°tjan Lah at Better.care; subsequent updates done by Thomas Beale at Ars Semantica & Graphite Health.
